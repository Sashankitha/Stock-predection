  Stock prediction in Python involves using data-driven techniques to forecast future stock prices or trends. Key methods include statistical approaches, machine learning (ML), and deep learning. The process typically begins with data collection, where historical stock prices and relevant financial indicators are gathered from sources like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.

Next, data preprocessing is essential to handle missing values, normalize features, and format data for ML models. Commonly used models include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. More complex algorithms such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, excel in sequential data tasks, making them popular for stock prediction due to their ability to capture time-dependent patterns.

Evaluation metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) help assess model accuracy. To enhance predictive performance, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and feature selection are employed. Techniques like ensemble learning or transfer learning may also improve model robustness.

Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow simplify model development. However, stock prediction remains challenging due to market volatility and non-linear behavior, which makes achieving high accuracy difficult.
